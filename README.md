# Lift Simulation Project

## Overview

This Lift Simulation project simulates the functioning of an elevator system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to interact with a virtual lift, selecting floors and observing lift movements in a simulated environment.

## Features

- **User Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI for selecting the number of lifts and floors.
- **Lift Controls**: Buttons for each floor to call the lift.
- **Realistic Simulation**: The lifts move smoothly between floors, simulating real-world behavior.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The lift status updates dynamically based on user interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout of the application.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic of the lift simulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Itskampitojha/lift-simulation
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd lift-simulation
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser**.

## Usage

1. Enter the number of lifts and floors in the provided input fields.
2. Click the "Start Simulation" button to initialize the lift system.
3. Use the buttons for each floor to call the lift and observe its movement.
